## 🛠️ My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (vanilla)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

As a recent graduate of a full-stack coding bootcamp (May 2025), this was the perfect refresher to reconnect with front-end fundamentals. I focused on:

- Structuring semantic HTML cleanly
- Centering and aligning elements with CSS
- Creating a card-like layout with padding, border-radius, and shadows
- Ensuring layout responsiveness and simplicity

This helped sharpen my eye for layout details and box modeling again — super valuable after more complex project work!

---

## 🚧 Continued Development

I plan to revisit other HTML/CSS challenges to strengthen visual layout speed and accuracy. I'd also like to recreate this component using Tailwind or React in the future.
